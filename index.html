                <img id="image" src="assets/images/personalPhoto.jpg" alt="Amer's photo" width="153px" height="141px"> My name is Amer Saleh and I am interested in a position for Entry Level Web Developer. I like to analyze people’s issues and solve it. I love working with people and know how difficult and frustrating it can be for someone when they facing problems how they expect.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My education, training, and experience have prepared me well for such a position. Not only do I have a degree in Computer Science, but I’ve also continued to take courses to expand my knowledge and skills in a variety of topics and tools over the past five years. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Also, I’ve dealt with a lot of local customers that are upset, annoyed, confused, or manipulative while I’ve worked at Home Depot. It helps me to be calm, sympathize with them and understand their problem from their point of view. In listening to the actions that cause their frustration you are not only letting them vent, you are hearing what their user experience is and their actions to resolve their problem. Sometimes they want you to do what they want when that won’t really fix the issue. You have to be patient and understanding while figuring out the root of the problem in order to get them quickly and correctly back into productive use of their products or systems.</p>
